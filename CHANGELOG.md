## Version 0.1-alpha

This first release provides tons of features: states, conditions, expressions, emitter block, trigger block, region block, crafting tables, quests, NPCs, factions, events, scripts, dialogues, quest chains, many commands, custom sound events, target selectors, global triggers, and much more.

**Compatible** with McLib **2.3** and optionally with Blockbuster **2.3** and Metamorph **1.2.7**. It doesn't mean that future versions of McLib, Blockbuster and Metamorph would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.
