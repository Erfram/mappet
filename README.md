**Mappet** is a Minecraft mod (for **1.12.2** exclusively) that is designed as a tool set for far superior adventure maps than possible with vanilla. It's also possible to use Mappet for scripted roleplays, and, to some extent, in Minecraft machinimas.

Special thanks to [Andruxioid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHOceBjwMyqCR5oYOoNqhQ) for the mod's name, Jvonlins, Centryfuga and [CustomNPCs Forever Vkontakte](https://vk.com/customnpcforever) group for testing, suggestions and directing!

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib) (version **2.3**), [Metamorph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph) (version **1.2.8**), and [Blockbuster](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockbuster) (version **2.3**). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Mappet mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Mappet didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.
